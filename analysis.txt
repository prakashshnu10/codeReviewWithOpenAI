Code Analysis:
The given code is a simple algorithm to find the majority element in an array. The majority element is the element that appears more than n/2 times in the array, where n is the size of the array.

Insights:
1. The algorithm iterates through the array and for each element, it counts the frequency of that element by iterating through the array again.
2. If the frequency of the current element is greater than n/2, then that element is returned as the majority element.

Time Complexity Analysis:
- Before Optimization:
  - The outer loop runs n times where n is the size of the array.
  - Inside the outer loop, the inner loop also runs n times for each iteration of the outer loop.
  - This results in an O(n^2) time complexity due to the nested loops.

Optimization:
To optimize the time complexity, we can use Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm, which has an O(n) time complexity for finding the majority element
